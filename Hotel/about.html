<h2><center> Early years (2008 – 2011)</center></h2><hr>
<h3>Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. The website started as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.[8][9][10]
    Zomato logo in 2012With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn.[11] Later in 2011, Zomato officially launched an online ticketing platform for events.[12]In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.[13] In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,[14] Qatar,[15] the United Kingdom,[16] the Philippines,[15] and South Africa.[17] In 2013, it expanded to New Zealand,[18] Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia, with websites and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and English languages.[19] In April 2014, it was launched in Chile and Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon, and Ireland in 2015.[20][21][22]
    In January 2015, Zomato acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia.[23] This U.S. expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare.[23]
    Late 2010sIn 2015, Zomato started its food delivery service in India,[24] initially partnering with companies such as Delhivery and Grab to fulfill deliveries from restaurants that did not have their own delivery service.[2
